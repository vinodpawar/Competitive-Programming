## Languages Used

- Java

## Getting Started

To run the solutions locally:

Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinodpawar/Competitive-Programming.git
   ```
   
## To execute a Java program on Windows:

Ensure Java is Installed
If Java is not installed, download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [official JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html). You can verify the installation by running the following command:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

### Compile the Java code

Open the Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to the directory containing the Java file, then compile the Java program:
   ```bash
   javac <solution>.java
   ```

### Run the Java program
After compilation, execute the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   java <solution>
   ```

## To execute a Java program on Linux:
Ensure Java is Installed
Check if Java is already installed by running
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

If itâ€™s not installed, you can install the Java Development Kit (JDK) using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install default-jdk
   ```

### Compile the Java Code
Open the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Java file, and compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac <solution>.java
   ```

### Run the Java Program
After successful compilation, run the Java program with:
   ```bash
   java <solution>
   ```
