## Languages Used

- Java

## Getting Started

To run the solutions locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinodpawar/Competitive-Programming.git
   ```
   
## To execute a Java program on Windows:

Ensure Java is Installed
If Java is not installed, download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [official JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html). You can verify the installation by running the following command:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
## Compile the Java code

Open the Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to the directory containing the Java file, then compile the Java program:
   ```bash
   javac <solution>.java
   ```
## Run the Java program
After compilation, execute the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   java <solution>
   ```
